## Abstract

This specification describes a method for Codex storage providers and client nodes to participate in a storage marketplace. 
The goal is to create a storage marketplace that promotes durability.

## Motivation
The Codex network aims to create a peer-to-peer storage engine with strong data durability, 
data persistence guarantees and node storage incentives.
To reach this goal, a data availability and retrieval mechanism is needed.
Support for light clients, like mobile devices should also be embraced.
The protocol should remove complexity to allow for simple implementation and 
simplify incentive mechanisms.

## Semantics 

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Definitions

| Terminology  | Description |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Storage Providers | A Codex node that provides storage services to the marketplace. |
| Validator Nodes | A Codex node that collects, validates and submits missing storage proofs for a reward. |
| Client Nodes | The most common Codex node that interacts with other nodes to locate and retrieve data. Also considered to be an ephemeral node (light client). |
| Slots | Created by client nodes when a new dataset is requested to be stored. Discussed further in the [slots section](#slots).  |

### Storage Request

Client nodes can create storage requests on the Codex marketplace via a smart contract on a EVM compatiable blockchain. 
Client nodes MUST split the dataset into data chunks, (C1,C2,C3...C20).

Using a erasure coding technique, 
the data chunks are encoded and placed into separate slots.
The RECCOMENDED erasure coding technique used for the Codex network is a [Reed-Soloman algorithm](https://hackmd.io/FB58eZQoTNm-dnhu0Y1XnA).

The requester, client node, SHOULD submit a transaction with the desired request parameters.
The requester MUST provide a `duration` value for the storage request along with the appropriate `reward`,
payment for request. 
Once a request is created via the transaction, 
all slots MUST be filled by storage providers before the request is officially started.
If the request does not attract enough storage providers after a pre-defined network timeout,
which is defined by the Codex node as `expire`,
the request MUST be canceled.
If canceled, `collateral` SHOULD be returned to any storage nodes and 
`reward` returned to the requester.
The requester MAY create a new request with different values to restart the process.

The requester SHOULD initiate the contract with the following values:

```nim

proc requestStorage (): {} =
  # content identifier
  byte32 cid = 1
  # Tokens from the requester to reward storage nodes
  UInt256 reward = 2
  # Amount of tokens required for collateral by storage nodes
  UInt256 collateral = 3
  # Frequency that proofs are checked by validator nodes
  byte proofProbability = 4
  # Amount of desired time for stoageRequest
  UInt256 duration = 5
  # The requester can choose amount of spreading of data to storage nodes
  uint dispersal = 6
  # Minimum Number of storage hosts 
  uint nodes = 7

}

```

`cid` 

- MUST be a sha2-256 hash (length of 32 bytes),
is a content identifier for the requested data to be stored
- MUST be generated by the requester, a regular node

`reward`

- SHOULD be a token known to the network.
- it MUST be paid directly to storage nodes that agree to storage contract

`collateral`

All storage nodes MUST provide token collateral before being able to fill a storage slot in the contract.
The collateral will be taken to punish a storage node when it does not follow the contract.
The following conditions related to a storage providers `collateral` MUST be fulfilled during a storage contract
- Failing to provide a periodic proof of storage,
a portion of the `collateral` MUST be offered as a reward to validator nodes,
and a portion SHOULD be offered as a reward to storage nodes that repair empty [slots](#slots).

`proofProbability`

Storage nodes are REQUIRED to provide proofs of storage that are verified by validator nodes.
The requester SHOULD provide the value for the frequency of proofs provided by storage nodes.

`duration`

- Once the `reward` has depleted from periodic storage node payment,
the storage request SHOULD end.
The requester MAY renew the storage request by creating a new request with the same `cid` value.
- Data MAY be considered lost during contract `duration` if storage nodes fail to provide storage proofs and
no other storage nodes decide to fill empty slots, see [slots](#slots) below.

`dispersal`

- Storage nodes MUST not allowed to fill all slots in a request.
- Requester SHOULD provide dispersal value

### Fulfilling Requests
In order a storage request to begin,
storage nodes MUST enter a storage contract with the requester via the marketplace smart contract.
When storage providers are choosen to participate in the contract,
storage providers MUST NOT leave the contract, unless the request is canceled, complete or forfiet of `collateral`.

#### Slots
Slots is a method used by the Codex network to distribute data chucks amongst storage providers.
Data chucks, created by clients nodes, MUST use a method of distributing for data resiliency.
- Client nodes MAY decide how many nodes should fill the slots of a storage contract.
- Storage providers MUST be selected by the Codex Network to fill a slot

Each slot represents a chunk of that data that needs to be stored by a storage provider.
The first state of a slot is reserved, meaning that the slot is waiting to be reserved by a storage provider.
The Codex network selects storage providers by using a variation of the Kademila distance function, 
as described in [dispersal](#dispersal).
After a slot reservation is secured, the storage provider MUST:
- provide token collateral and proof of storage to fill the slot
- provide pericaioc proofs of storage

A slot MUST become empty after the storage provider fails to provide enough proofs of storage to validator nodes.
The storage provider assigned to that slot MUST forfeit its `collateral`.
Other storage nodes can earn a small portion of the forfeited `collateral` by providing a new proof of storage and `collateral`,
this is referred to as repairing the empty slot.

The slot lifecycle is demonstrated below:

                                    v                                    v
                                Update slashCriterion                 collateral
                                                                   lost
