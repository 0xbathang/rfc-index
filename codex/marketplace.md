## Abstract

This specification describes a method for Codex hosts and client nodes to participate in a storage marketplace. The goal is to create a storage marketplace that promotes durability.

## Motivation
Codex aims to create a peer-to-peer storage engine with strong data availability, data persistence guarantees and node storage incentivies.
To reach this goal, a data availibilty and retrievaial mechanism is needed.
Support for light clients, like mobile devices should also be embraced.
The protocol should remove complexity to allow for simple implementation and 
simplify incentive mechanism.

## Semantics 

### Definitions

| Terminology  | Description |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Storage Nodes | A Codex node that provide storage services to the marketplace.|
| Validator Nodes | A Codex node that collects, validates, and submits proofs to reward or penilize other storage nodes or validator nodes. |
| Regular Nodes | The Main Codex client that interacts with other nodes to locate and retrieve data. Can also be considered a ephemeral node(light client) |
| Slots | An agreement with storage nodes and regular nodes to store data |


### Storage Request

A Codex regular node can request storage of arbitrary data by creating open slots on the blockchain. 
When a request is made by a regular node,
a storage contract is opened on the marketplace via the blockchain, and 
storage nodes can then decide to store the data.
The requester SHOULD initiate the contract with the following:

```protobuf

requestStorage {
  // content identifier
  byte cid = 1
  // Tokens from the requester to reward storage nodes
  byte reward = 2
  // Amount of tokens required for collateral by storage nodes
  byte collateral = 3
  // Frequency that proofs are checked by validator nodes
  byte proofProbability = 4
  //
  proofParameters = 5
  // Amount of desired time for stoageRequest
  uint64 duration = 6
  //The requester can choose amount of spreading of data to storage nodes
  dispersal = 7
  //
  repair = 8
  // Number of storage hosts 
  uint nodes = 9
  //
  uint tolerance = 10
  // Timeout set for slots to be filled
  expire = 11
}

```

`cid` 
- MUST be a sha2-256 hash (length 32 bytes, base58) of the data being stored
- MUST be generated by the requester, or regular node
`reward`
- SHOULD be token known to the network.
- it MUST be paid directly to storage nodes that agree to contract

`collateral`
All storage nodes MUST provide token collateral before being able to fullfill a storage contract.
The collateral will taken to punish the storage node when that node does not follow the contract.
The following conditions MUST be fullfilled in a Codex storage contract
- failing to provide proofs periodically, the RECOMMENDED method for proofs is [Proof-of-Data-Possession](https://hackmd.io/2uRBltuIT7yX0CyczJevYg?view).
- a portion of `collateral` MUST be offered as rewards vaildator nodes,
and a portion SHOULD be offered as reward to storage nodes that repair [slots](##slots)

`proofProbability`
