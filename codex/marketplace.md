## Abstract

This specification describes a method for Codex hosts and client nodes to participate in a storage marketplace. The goal is to create a storage marketplace that promotes durability.

## Motivation
Codex aims to create a peer-to-peer storage engine with strong data availability, data persistence guarantees and node storage incentivies.
To reach this goal, a data availibilty and retrievaial mechanism is needed.
Support for light clients, like mobile devices should also be embraced.
The protocol should remove complexity to allow for simple implementation and 
simplify incentive mechanism.

## Semantics 

### Definitions

| Terminology  | Description |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Storage Nodes | A Codex node that provide storage services to the marketplace.|
| Validator Nodes | A Codex node that collects, validates, and submits proofs to reward or penilize other storage nodes or validator nodes. |
| Regular Nodes | The Main Codex client that interacts with other nodes to locate and retrieve data. Can also be considered a ephemeral node(light client) |
| Slots | An agreement with storage nodes and regular nodes to store data |


### Storage Request

A Codex regular node can request storage of data by opening a storage contract on the blockchain. 
The storage contract is opened on the marketplace via the blockchain, and 
the data is split into blocks with erasure coding and placed in to slots for the request,
slots discussed below. 

The requester MUST provide `duration` of the storage request along with the appropriate `reward`,
payment for request, before the contract is created. 
Once a contract is created, 
all slots MUST be filled by storage nodes before the request is officially started.
If the request does not attract enough storage nodes after a pre-defined network timeout,
the request SHOULD be canceled.
If canceled, `collateral` SHOULD be returned to any storage nodes and 
`reward` retruned to the requester.
The requester MAY create a new request with different values to attract storage nodes.

The requester SHOULD initiate the contract with the following values:

```nim

proc requestStorage (): {} =
  # content identifier
  byte32 cid = 1
  # Tokens from the requester to reward storage nodes
  UInt256 reward = 2
  # Amount of tokens required for collateral by storage nodes
  UInt256 collateral = 3
  # Frequency that proofs are checked by validator nodes
  byte proofProbability = 4
  # Amount of desired time for stoageRequest
  UInt256 duration = 5
  # The requester can choose amount of spreading of data to storage nodes
  dispersal = 6
  # Number of storage hosts 
  uint nodes = 7
  # 
  uint tolerance = 8

}

```

`cid` 

- MUST be a sha2-256 hash (length 32 bytes, base58) of the data being stored
- MUST be generated by the requester, or regular node

`reward`

- SHOULD be token known to the network.
- it MUST be paid directly to storage nodes that agree to contract

`collateral`

All storage nodes MUST provide token collateral before being able to fullfill a storage contract.
The collateral will be taken to punish a storage node when it does not follow the contract.
The following conditions MUST be fullfilled in a Codex storage contract
- failing to provide proof of storage periodically, the RECOMMENDED method for proofs is [Proof-of-Data-Possession](https://hackmd.io/2uRBltuIT7yX0CyczJevYg?view).
- a portion of `collateral` MUST be offered as rewards vaildator nodes,
and a portion SHOULD be offered as reward to storage nodes that repair [slots](##slots)

`proofProbability`

`duration`

- Once the `reward` has depleted from steady storage node payment,
the storage request SHOULD end.
The requester MAY renew the storage request by creating a new request with the same `cid`.
- 



### Slots

After a storage request is made, 
the requester's Codex node will create slots using erasure coding.
Each slot will contain a data block being stored.
- Storage Nodes MUST provide token collateral and proof of storage to fill a slot
- If storage nodes fails to provide proof of storage in a given period,
the slot will become empty.
