## Abstract

This specification describes the varies components comprising the data availability portion for the Nomos base layer.

## Background
Nomos is a cluster of blockchains known as zones.
Zones are layer 2 blockchains that utilize Nomos to maintain sovereignty.
Nomos blockchain has two layers that are the most important components for zones. 
The first layer is the base layer which provides a data availibility guarantees to the network. 
The second layer is the coordination layer which enables state transition verification through zero-knowledge validity proofs. 
Nomos zones can to utilize the base layer so users, light clients, 
have the ability to obtain all block data and process it locally.
To achieve this, 
the data availbilty mechanism within Nomos provides guarantees that transaction data within Nomos Zones to be vaild.
