# Vac Request For Comments(RFC)

*NOTE*: This repo is WIP. We are currently restructuring the RFC process.

This repository contains specifications from the [Waku](https://waku.org/), [Nomos](https://nomos.tech/), 
[Codex](https://codex.storage/), and [Status](https://status.app/) projects that are part of the [IFT portfolio](https://free.technology/).
[Vac](https://vac.dev) is an [IFT service](https://free.technology/services) that will manage the RFC process within this repository.
The goal of the RFC, [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments),
process is to standardize technical specifications. 
Specifications will adhere to [1/COSS](./vac/1/coss.md) by obtaining a rough consensus within each project.
